## This is an example of how to define an envil set of environments,
## each one with its set of packages (tools)

includes:
  [] # You can refer to a list of other statedirs that will be included in the state.
  # If this yaml defines envs or inputs that are named the same than
  # inputs/envs defined by an imported statedir, the ones here will
  # override the imported ones.
  # Relative paths in "includes" are considered relative to this file
inputs: # 'inputs' are "package sources" in nix flakes parlance
  pkgs: # Here we just give a name to an input
    "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable"
    # ^^ Here we tell envil & Nix where to fetch it. This is a nix flake URL
  nushellWith:
    "github:YPares/nushellWith": # A flake URL like above, but with some extra config
      nixpkgs: pkgs
      # ^^ This is a "follows" link. It means that the 'nushellWith' input
      # has a 'nixpkgs' input, that we ask to follow our own 'pkgs' input declared just above,
      # instead of using its own locked version
envs:
  nix: # This declares and environment, and names it (you can use any name
    # except 'default', which is reserved)
    contents: # Which packages should be provided by the environment when it is activated
      pkgs: # A package source (from 'inputs')
        - nil # Which packages to use from that source
        - nixfmt-classic
        - cachix

    extends: # This is how an environment "inherits" from others, so you
      # don't have to repeat yourself
